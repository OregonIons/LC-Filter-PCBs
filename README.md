# LC-Filter-PCBs
LC filter board PCB designs.

Allows for a wide variety of LC filters (up to 5-pole) to be rapidly prototyped.  

Capacitors pads are 0805.  

Inductors pads are custom pads that allow any of the following to be installed:  
[Coilcraft 1812LS](https://www.coilcraft.com/1812ls.cfm) - Ferrite core chip inductors 12-1000uH  
[Coilcraft 1812CS](https://www.coilcraft.com/1812cs.cfm) - Ceramic core chip inductors 1-33uH  
[Coilcraft 1515SQ, 2222Q, 2929Q](https://www.coilcraft.com/1515sq.cfm) - Air core inductors 47-500nH  

Filters can be conveniently designed using the [iFilter](https://www.awr.com/software/options/ifilter) feature of [AWR Design Environment](https://www.awr.com/software/products/awr-design-environment).

Board design in Altium.  Pdf files can be found in [releases](https://github.com/OregonIons/LC-Filter-PCBs/releases).



An enclosure design is forthcoming.  In the mean time, edge mount SMAs can be used for testing.

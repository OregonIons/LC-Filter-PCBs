# LC-Filter-PCBs
LC filter board PCB designs.

Allows for a wide variety of LC filters (up to 5-pole) to be rapidly prototyped.  

Capacitors pads are 0805.  

Inductors pads are custom pads that allow any of the following to be installed: 
Coilcraft 1812LS - Ferrite core chip inductor 12-1000uH
Coilcraft 1812CS - Ceramic core chip inductor 1-33uH
Coilcraft 1515SQ, 2222Q, 2929Q - Air core inductor 47-500nH

Design in Altium.  Pdf files can be found in 'releases'.

An enclosure design is forthcoming.  In the mean time, edge mount SMAs can be used for testing.
